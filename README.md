# Machine-learning-algorithms : This repo is the compilation of all possible ML algorithms required for pursuing data science.

1. KNN Algorithm: A simple but powerful approach for making predictions is to use the most similar historical examples to the new data. This is the principle behind 
the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
the file contains:
How to code the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm step-by-step.
How to evaluate k-Nearest Neighbors on a real dataset.
How to use k-Nearest Neighbors to make a prediction for new data
